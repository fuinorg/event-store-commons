# event-store-commons
Defines a common event store Java interface and provides some adapters (like for Greg Young's [event store](https://www.geteventstore.com/)) and implementations (like in-memory or file-based).

# Status
**This is work in progress** - *Don't expect the interfaces to be stable or the code to be well tested yet...*
