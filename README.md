Defines a common event store Java interface and provides some adapters (like for Greg Young's [event store](https://www.geteventstore.com/)) and implementations (like in-memory or file-based).

# Status
**This is work in progress** - Don't expect it to be stable in regard to the interfaces or well tested...
