  Scenario: Non existing once
    Given the following streams don't exist
      | Stream Name        |
      | NameDoesNotMatter1 |
      | NameDoesNotMatter2 |
      | NameDoesNotMatter3 |
      | NameDoesNotMatter4 |
      | NameDoesNotMatter5 |
      | NameDoesNotMatter6 |
    When the following deletes are executed

      | NameDoesNotMatter1 | true        | ANY                | -                             |
      | NameDoesNotMatter2 | true        | NO_OR_EMPTY_STREAM | -                             |
#   | NameDoesNotMatter3 | false       | ANY                | -                             |

    Then this should give the expected results

  Scenario: Read after delete
    Given the following streams are created and a single event is appended to each
      | Stream Name         |
      | ReadAfterHardDelete |
