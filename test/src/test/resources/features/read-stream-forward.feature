Feature: Read a stream forward

  Scenario: Illegal start or count
    When I read forward from the following streams
      | Stream Name       | Start | Count | Expected Exception                                     | Expected Message                                |
      | NameDoesNotMatter | -1    | 1     | org.fuin.objects4j.common.ConstraintViolationException | Min value of argument 'start' is 0, but was: -1 |
      | NameDoesNotMatter | 1     | 0     | org.fuin.objects4j.common.ConstraintViolationException | Min value of argument 'count' is 1, but was: 0  |
    Then this should give the expected results

  Scenario: Read non existing
    Given the following streams don't exist
      | Stream Name       |
      | NameDoesNotMatter |
    When I read forward from the following streams
      | Stream Name       | Start | Count | Expected Exception      |
      | NameDoesNotMatter | 1     | 1     | StreamNotFoundException |
    Then this should give the expected results

  Scenario: Append and read single
    Given the stream "AppendSingleForward" does not exist
    When I append the following events in the given order
      | Stream Name         | Expected Version   | Event Id                             |
      | AppendSingleForward | NO_OR_EMPTY_STREAM | a3d80db0-f35e-45f0-817f-648d07ad7391 |
    Then reading forward from stream should have the following results
      | Stream Name         | Start | Count | Result From | Result Next | End Of Stream | Result Event Id 1                    |
      | AppendSingleForward | 0     | 1     | 0           | 1           | false         | a3d80db0-f35e-45f0-817f-648d07ad7391 |
      | AppendSingleForward | 1     | 1     | 1           | 1           | true          | -                                    |

  Scenario: Append and read multiple
    Given the stream "AppendMultipleForward" does not exist
    When I append the following events in the given order
      | Stream Name           | Expected Version   | Event Id                             |
      | AppendMultipleForward | NO_OR_EMPTY_STREAM | 26d53452-30a8-473b-b5cc-58650265dfb3 |
      | AppendMultipleForward | 0                  | 6e4f3687-ccec-496b-8c22-c3848e6f2250 |
      | AppendMultipleForward | 1                  | 2ce79b07-020c-4908-ad6f-cd63498d4c9f |
      | AppendMultipleForward | 2                  | cf27403b-f701-4288-9668-6173e9dbce71 |
      | AppendMultipleForward | 3                  | ce75244f-c3f6-44a0-a263-c94abf0ac480 |
    Then reading forward from stream should have the following results
      | Stream Name           | Start | Count | Result From | Result Next | End Of Stream | Result Event Id 1                    | Result Event Id 2                    | Result Event Id 3                    |
      | AppendMultipleForward | 0     | 3     | 0           | 3           | false         | 26d53452-30a8-473b-b5cc-58650265dfb3 | 6e4f3687-ccec-496b-8c22-c3848e6f2250 | 2ce79b07-020c-4908-ad6f-cd63498d4c9f |
      | AppendMultipleForward | 3     | 3     | 3           | 5           | true          | cf27403b-f701-4288-9668-6173e9dbce71 | ce75244f-c3f6-44a0-a263-c94abf0ac480 | -                                    |

  Scenario: Append and read all
    Given the stream "AppendAllForward" does not exist
    When I append the following events in the given order
      | Stream Name      | Expected Version   | Event Id                             |
      | AppendAllForward | NO_OR_EMPTY_STREAM | 26d53452-30a8-473b-b5cc-58650265dfb3 |
      | AppendAllForward | 0                  | 6e4f3687-ccec-496b-8c22-c3848e6f2250 |
      | AppendAllForward | 1                  | 2ce79b07-020c-4908-ad6f-cd63498d4c9f |

    Then reading all events from stream "AppendAllForward" starting at position 0 with chunk size 3 should have the following results
      | Result Event Id 1                    | Result Event Id 2                    | Result Event Id 3                    |

    And reading all events from stream "AppendAllForward" starting at position 1 with chunk size 3 should have the following results
      | Result Event Id 1                    | Result Event Id 2                    | Result Event Id 3                    |
      | 6e4f3687-ccec-496b-8c22-c3848e6f2250 | 2ce79b07-020c-4908-ad6f-cd63498d4c9f | cf27403b-f701-4288-9668-6173e9dbce71 |

    And reading all events from stream "AppendAllForward" starting at position 2 with chunk size 2 should have the following results
      | Result Event Id 1                    | Result Event Id 2                    |
      | 2ce79b07-020c-4908-ad6f-cd63498d4c9f | cf27403b-f701-4288-9668-6173e9dbce71 |
