Feature: Stream state

  Scenario: All states
    Given the stream "NameDoesNotMatter" does not exist
    And the following streams are created and a single event is appended to each
      | Stream Name      |
      | StateExisting    |
      | StateHardDeleted |
      | StateSoftDeleted |
    And the following deletes are executed
      | Stream Name      | Hard Delete | Expected Version |
      | StateHardDeleted | true        | ANY              |
      | StateSoftDeleted | false       | ANY              |
    When the following state queries are executed
      | Stream Name       | Expected State | Expected Exception      |
      | NameDoesNotMatter | -              | StreamNotFoundException |
      | StateExisting     | ACTIVE         | -                       |
      | StateHardDeleted  | HARD_DELETED   | -                       |
      | StateSoftDeleted  | -              | StreamNotFoundException |
    Then this should give the expected results
    And following streams should exist
      | Stream Name   |
      | StateExisting |
    And following streams should not exist
      | Stream Name       |
      | NameDoesNotMatter |
      | StateHardDeleted  |
      | StateSoftDeleted  |
