# esc-jpa

Java Persistence API (JPA) based implementation of the event store commons api.

## Entity types

There are two different scenarios:

1. Streams that require one or more discriminator columns
2. Streams without the need for a discriminator column

An example for streams with discriminator columns is the below-mentioned "Vendor" aggregate. There is only one
stream entity (table) and one event entity (table) for **all** vendors. The vendor's ID is used as discriminator
column to distinguish events for the different vendors.

The discriminator is coded in
the [stream identifier](https://github.com/fuinorg/event-store-commons/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/fuin/esc/api/StreamId.java).
An example of an identifier with discriminator column is
the [AggregateStreamId](src/test/java/org/fuin/esc/jpa/examples/AggregateStreamId.java) and another one for an
identifier without a discriminator is
the [SimpleStreamId](https://github.com/fuinorg/event-store-commons/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/fuin/esc/api/SimpleStreamId.java).

The good new is: There is no need to create any entities if you don't need a discriminator column. There are already
two predefined entites [NoParamsEvent](src/main/java/org/fuin/esc/jpa/NoParamsEvent.java) and
[NoParamsStream](src/main/java/org/fuin/esc/jpa/NoParamsStream.java) that will be used automatically in this case.
For streams that require discriminator columns you have to create two entity classes ("XyzEvent" + "XyzStream") named as
described below.

## Custom naming of tables and entities

You can use [JpaStreamId](src/main/java/org/fuin/esc/jpa/JpaStreamId.java) to define the names of your stream entities
and classes.
There are two predfined classes [SimpleJpaStreamId](src/main/java/org/fuin/esc/jpa/SimpleJpaStreamId.java) and
[ProjectionJpaStreamId](src/main/java/org/fuin/esc/jpa/ProjectionJpaStreamId.java) that already implement this
interface.

## Default naming conventions

If you don't define an explicit stream name using a [JpaStreamId](src/main/java/org/fuin/esc/jpa/JpaStreamId.java),
a strict default naming convention applies. **You have to name your tables and identifiers exactly as described below
otherwise it will not work**.

### StreamId

Use a camel case stream identifier name that ends *not* on 'Stream', 'Streams', 'Event' or 'Events'.

```java
StreamId streamId = new AggregateStreamId("YourSelectedName", discriminatorValue);
```

### Event entity

Table name is the same as the stream identifier plus '_EVENTS' and uses an 'underscore' for replacing camel case parts.
Class name is the same as the stream identifier plus 'Event' (Note that there is no 's' at the end!).

```java
@Table(name = "YOUR_SELECTED_NAME_EVENTS")
@Entity
public class YourSelectedNameEvent extends JpaStreamEvent { 
    // ... 
}
```

### Stream entity

Table name is the same as the stream identifier plus '_STREAMS' and uses an 'underscore' for replacing camel case
parts.   
Class name is the same as the stream identifier plus 'Stream' (Note that there is no 's' at the end!).

```java
@Table(name = "YOUR_SELECTED_NAME_STREAMS")
@Entity
public class YourSelectedNameStream extends JpaStream { 
    // ... 
}
```

## Example JPA entity structure

The UML diagram shows how events of an example "Vendor" aggregate are stored in the database.
A [VendorStream](src/test/java/org/fuin/esc/jpa/examples/VendorStream.java) has information about the stream itself
and [VendorEvent](src/test/java/org/fuin/esc/jpa/examples/VendorEvent.java) has a reference to the event table.
The [JpaEvent](src/main/java/org/fuin/esc/jpa/JpaEvent.java) table contains the real event data.
